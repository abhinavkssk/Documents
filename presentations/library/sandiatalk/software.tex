\royitemizebegin{Goals}
\item Improved test coverage and reliability
\item Hiding implementation details from user code
\item Rapid prototyping of new formulations
\item Physics-dependent error estimators
\royitemizeend

\royitemizebegin{Methods}
\item Object-oriented System and Solver subclasses
\item Factoring common patterns into library code
\item Per-element Numerical Jacobian verification
\royitemizeend

\begin{minipage}[h]{.45\textwidth}
\royitemizebegin{}
\item Generalized IBVP representation
\item FEMSystem does all initialization, global assembly
\item User code only needs weighted time derivative residuals
$(\dt{u}, v_i) = F_i(u)$ and/or constraints $G_i(u, v_i) = 0$

old solutions
