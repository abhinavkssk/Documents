Title: AMR Infrastructure expansion, adding complexity, examples

Abstract:
In this talk I will continue to discuss expansion of the
infrastructure for parallel adaptive HPC simulations introduced in the
preceeding lectures and again use libmesh as a case study to
illustrate the approaches. Some particular aaspects to be covered
include:Numerical Jacobians for calculation and software
validation;Object Oriented decomposition of transient boundary value
problem solvers;Adaptive Refinement / Coarsening strategies;C1
elements and macroelements;Techniques for hanging node constraints and
refinement/coarsening projections on general elements. Application
studies will be employed to demonstrate the schemes and algorithm
extensions.
