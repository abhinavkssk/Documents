Title: Object Oriented Boundary Value Problem Abstractions

Abstract:
This talk will discuss abstract representations of systems of
equations, nonlinear solvers, finite element spaces and time
discretization algorithms, adaptivity strategies, and other components
of a code to solve a typical transient boundary value problem.  The
use of object oriented programming to help modularize these components
will be explained, with example class inheritance diagrams based on
libMesh.  The implications for software validation, rapid prototyping, 
and research experimentation will be demonstrated with example
application studies.


Title: Parallelism on Adaptive Unstructured Meshes

Abstract:
As parallel computing becomes a fixture in even the desktop
environment, supercomputers are growing from thousands to tens of
thousands of nodes.  Serial algorithms and serialized data structures
which are effective on a few or a few dozen nodes can become
bottlenecks as the number of processors scales up.  This talk will
describe some of the parallel algorithms and distributed data
structures under recent development in libMesh.  The interaction of
parallel mesh distribution with adaptive mesh refinement and
coarsening, degree of freedom ordering, and application-level code
will be discussed.
