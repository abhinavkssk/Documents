\begin{minipage}[h]{.45\textwidth}
\royitemizebegin{}
\item Generalized IBVP representation
\item FEMSystem does all initialization, global assembly
\item User code only needs weighted time derivative residuals
$(\dt{u}, v_i) = F_i(u)$ and/or constraints $G_i(u, v_i) = 0$
\royitemizeend

\begin{minipage}[h]{.45\textwidth}
\royitemizebegin{}
\item Calls user code on each element
\item Assembles element-by-element time derivatives, constraints, and weighted
old solutions

\begin{minipage}[h]{.45\textwidth}
\royitemizebegin{}
\item Acquires residuals, jacobians from FEMSystem assembly

\royslide{Element-based BVP Framework}{

\royitemizebegin{Pros}
\item Enables non-global physics-based error estimators
\item Removes dependencies, complications from application level
\item Gives user access to more tested code
\item Enables element-by-element Jacobian verification
\royitemizeend

\royitemizebegin{Cons}
\item Adds additional per-element virtual function calls
\item Complicates time-dependent stabilization methods
\item Complicates operator splitting methods
\royitemizeend
