%\usetheme{default} % No navigation bars!
%\usetheme{boxes} % puts a box a in the head and footline, looks like default unless

%\usetheme{Bergen} % huge left-hand column. informal feel
%\usetheme{Boadilla} % shows page count at bottom.  requires institute
%\usetheme{Madrid} % Like Boadilla, but more color contrast
%\usetheme{Pittsburgh} % right-flushed titles, otherwise very sparse
%\usetheme{Rochester}  % Huge title bars dominating the slide. square corners, no drop shadows
%\usetheme{Antibes}     % Large, Tree-based navigation at the top with sharp corners. Not bad
%\usetheme{JuanLesPins}  % Smooth version of Antibes, no lines in nav tree.
%\usetheme{Montpellier}  % To me, it looks like Antibes.  No box backgrounds.
%\usetheme{Darmstadt} %fuzzy top title bars, drop shadows, circle bullets,
                     % no side column. The top title is very busy
%\usetheme{Frankfurt}  % fuzzy title bars running across

%\usetheme{Berlin} % Square edges and bullets, no drop shadows, no rounded blocks
%\usetheme{Ilmenau} % Similar to Berlin, mini-nav frame, no drop shadows, rounded corners
%\usetheme{Dresden} % Like Berlin, but no block outlines. minimal context, lots of nav, but not bad
\usetheme{Darmstadt} % Berlin with no bottom nav and rounded blocks, pretty nice, a bit too much at top though
%\usetheme{Frankfurt} % Very nice! Like Darmstadt but with less nav at the top
%\usetheme{Singapore} % top title bar has a faded appearance, centered title names, minimal bullets.
%\usetheme{Szeged} % Lots of horizontal lines. Pretty nice but too cluttered at the top

% \usetheme{Berkeley} %side-bar menu screws up the spacing of slides somewhat, use with sidebartab

%\usetheme{Copenhagen} % tabular navigation, flat look (no shadows) too much top clutter
%\usetheme{Malmoe} % top cluttered

%\usetheme{Warsaw} % top is cluttered and even has a drop shadow

% \usecolortheme{sidebartab} % Used with sidebartab, it's really not bad

%\usetheme{Marburg} % A more dominant Goettingen, harder to read sidebar

% Dr. Carey's Notes:
% I had in mind some of the material we have in the Libmesh papers well 
% as  from the perspective of:(1) a very knowlegable  developer,(2) 
% installing an application with experience (3)  applying an 
% application for parametric runs  with some examples. perhaps some of 
% the issues encounter, as in all such codes like stopping criteria for 
% adaptive refinement, selection of error indicators, flexibility in 
% model adaption, ( adding terms, modifying constitutive models etc). 
% perhaps something on the coarsening /refining ; one level exceptions 
% etc. it would be helpful if you, Ben and Roy coordinated this. 
% Someone should talk about PETSc, partitioning etc. Someone about 
% memory restrictions etc. Strengths and limitations.  examples, couple 
% of movies etc etc


% Abstract:
% This talk will focus on several of the practical aspects involved in
% using the LibMesh library for finite element analysis.  The topics
% covered will include: the steps in going from a mathematical model
% (PDE) to a working implementation (code), stopping criteria for
% adaptive refinement, the selection of error indicators, and model
% adaptation (adding terms, changing constitutive laws, etc).  The
% strengths, weaknesses, and current limitations of the library will
% be discussed in the same practical context.  Finally, some additional
% examples giving a flavor of the types of applications which have
% already been developed around the library will be given.
