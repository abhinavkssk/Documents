\begin{foil}{Lid-Driven Cavity}

The lid-driven cavity provides an adaptivity-friendly divergence-free
shear-thinning 2D Navier-Stokes test: a square domain has zero
velocity enforced on three sides and a constant lateral velocity along
the top.

\begin{foil}{Corner Singularities}

Because the velocity boundary conditions are discontinuous at the
corners, the streamfunction's first derivative is also discontinuous
and its second derivatives are singular.  As $r \rightarrow 0$,

\vspace{-2em}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\psi(r,\theta) & = & \frac{r}{\pi^2 - 4}
\left( -\pi^2 \sin(\theta) + 2 \pi \theta \sin(\theta) + 
4 \theta \cos(\theta) \right) \\
\vorticity(r, \theta) & = & \frac{1}{(\pi^2 - 4) r}
\left( 4 \pi \cos(\theta) - 8 \sin(\theta) \right)
\end{eqnarray*}
\vspace{-2em}

Without removing these singularities analytically, finite element
simulations at high Reynolds numbers and on coarse meshes are often
corrupted by numerical oscillation.

\begin{foil}{Divergence-free Elements}
Replacing $\vec{v}_i$ with $\nabla \times \vec{\phi}_i$ in the
divergence-free flow equations, we find integrated products of second
derivatives of $\vec{\phi}_i$.

The linear Dirichlet problem is well-posed only in an affine space to
$H^2_0(\Omega)$, so any Galerkin finite element approximation must
use $H^2$ conforming functions as well.

A $C^1$ continuous (and $C^n$ bounded, therefore $W^{2,p}$ conforming)
finite element is needed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Powell-Sabin 6-split triangle
	\item Powell-Sabin-Heindl 12-split triangle
	\item Clough-Tocher 3-split triangle
\end{itemize}
\end{foil}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{foil}{Macroelements}

Constraining a polynomial triangle to $C^1$ continuity along edges
requires a higher polynomial degree (quintics) than is desired for
many approximations.  Instead, we can construct a macroelement by
subdividing the triangle, using piecewise polynomial functions, and
adding continuity constraints along interior edges.

\begin{foil}{Adaptive Macroelements}

Nonconforming meshes are only stable if solutions are not ``locked''
at hanging nodes.  Function spaces on the sides of fine elements must
be supersets of function spaces on the adjoining sides of coarse
elements.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{foil}{Hanging Node Constraints}

Adaptive mesh refinement creates a non-conforming mesh.  Forming a
$C^1$ conforming function space requires constraining hanging node
degrees of freedom on fine elements in terms of degrees of freedom on
coarse parent elements.

\begin{foil}{Solution Projections}

A good library projection function is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Locally computable
	\item Uniquely defined
	\item Independent of element type
\end{itemize}

Global Hilbert projections are not locally computable.
Element projections are not uniquely defined.
Pointwise evaluations are not FE independent.
