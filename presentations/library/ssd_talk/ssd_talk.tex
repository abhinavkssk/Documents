%% Abstract
%% 
%% LibMesh is an open-source finite element library that was originally
%% developed to facilitate serial and parallel simulation of multiscale,
%% multiphysics applications using adaptive mesh refinement and
%% coarsening strategies.  The library was created in the CFDLab at the
%% University of Texas's Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics
%% Department, but, as with other open-source software projects,
%% contributions are being made elsewhere in the US and abroad.  In this
%% talk, which will be geared toward a general audience, we will describe
%% the underlying philosophy and software design approach used in the
%% library.  We will give additional details on the adaptive mesh
%% refinement and coarsening (AMR/C) schemes utilized, and finally,
%% describe our implementations in the key areas of domain decomposition,
%% message passing, and parallel mesh data structures.  Other topics
%% include: discussion of C++ programming paradigms (scientific software
%% and the STL) software reusability in the face of diverse user
%% applications, and integration with high-level threading APIs for
%% making efficient use of hybrid parallel architectures.  Finally,
%% results from some of the various applications which utilize the
%% library are presented, and areas of future research are discussed.
