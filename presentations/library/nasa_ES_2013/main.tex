% Dr. Carey's Notes:
% I had in mind some of the material we have in the Libmesh papers well 
% as  from the perspective of:(1) a very knowlegable  developer,(2) 
% installing an application with experience (3)  applying an 
% application for parametric runs  with some examples. perhaps some of 
% the issues encounter, as in all such codes like stopping criteria for 
% adaptive refinement, selection of error indicators, flexibility in 
% model adaption, ( adding terms, modifying constitutive models etc). 
% perhaps something on the coarsening /refining ; one level exceptions 
% etc. it would be helpful if you, Ben and Roy coordinated this. 
% Someone should talk about PETSc, partitioning etc. Someone about 
% memory restrictions etc. Strengths and limitations.  examples, couple 
% of movies etc etc


% Abstract:
% This talk will focus on several of the practical aspects involved in
% using the LibMesh library for finite element analysis.  The topics
% covered will include: the steps in going from a mathematical model
% (PDE) to a working implementation (code), stopping criteria for
% adaptive refinement, the selection of error indicators, and model
% adaptation (adding terms, changing constitutive laws, etc).  The
% strengths, weaknesses, and current limitations of the library will
% be discussed in the same practical context.  Finally, some additional
% examples giving a flavor of the types of applications which have
% already been developed around the library will be given.
