Abstract:

In this paper we describe the libMesh framework for parallel
adaptive finite element applications.  libMesh is an open-source
software library that has been developed to facilitate serial and
parallel simulation of multiscale, multiphysics applications using
adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening strategies.  The main software
development is being carried out in the CFDLab at the University of
Texas, but as with other open-source software projects; contributions
are being made elsewhere in the U.S. and abroad.  The main goals of
this article are: (1) to provide a basic reference source that
describes libMesh and the underlying philosophy and software design
approach; (2) to give sufficient detail and references on the adaptive
mesh refinement and coarsening (AMR/C) scheme for applications
analysts and developers; and (3) to describe the parallel
implementation and data structures with supporting discussion of
domain decomposition, message passing, and details related to dynamic
repartitioning for parallel AMR/C.  Other aspects related to C++
programming paradigms, reusability for diverse applications, adaptive
modeling, and similar concepts are briefly discussed. Finally, results
from some applications using the library are presented and areas of
future research are discussed.
